Medical reports often conatain technical terminology that-
1)causes confusion and anxiety
2)Leads to misinterpretation
3)creates unnecessary panic
4)Excludes non-English speakers

Our project bridges this gap by tranforming complex medical text into simple,contextual expalnation without diagnosing or prescribing

Some Key Features of our project are-
1)OCR based Report Scanning
2)AI powered medical explanation
3)Text to speech
4)Multilingual Support

We also made sure to have proper security of the users by using firebase authentication and email-password login

But we also provided a disclaimer that mediclear provides educational explanation only.It does not diagnose medical conditions or recommend treatment.Users must consult licensed medical professional fro clinical decisions
